## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Fetch data from JSON into HTML.  
I took the initiative to change some data in the json file. I replace the image path with a class name.  
The icons are managed with CSS with the pseudo element ***::before***.  

I also decided to use Git only via the console, and not using the GUI of GitHub Desktop.  
To implement the counter *(see [Continued development](#continued-development))*, I created a branch where I worked on my *feature*, and merged the results, without any interaction with the GUI. Except for the GitHub website, to create the remote folder and have the URL.

### Continued development

After I was done, I thought I could add something extra.  
That big number in the circle needed something to look better, to be more "Tadaaaaaa!". 
Why not make it a counter from 0 to the final score. And voil√†, done! ü§©
